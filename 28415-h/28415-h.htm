<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<div style="font-size: 90%">

<p>The play idea will always appeal to the minds of children. History,
so often thought to be a dry subject, is made a live wide awake game
when the pupils live the parts. The great men and women of history
are made real to them.</p>

<p>This method has been worked out by the pupils in the fifth grade in
the McKinley School in San Francisco and found to be most
successful.</p>

<p>The chief characters in Mace's Beginners History, the California
State Text, have been dramatized. The children read the story and
study by outline. Then with the help of the teacher the important
events are made into a play.</p>

<p>Much outside reading is encouraged. This awakens an interest in good
reading and an ability to do independent studying.</p>

<p>The lives of great men and women represent great things. Studying
about these people is an inspiration to the children for the bigger
and nobler things of life.</p>

<p class="indentverse">
"Lives of great men, all remind us<br />
We can make our lives sublime,<br />
And departing leave behind us&mdash;<br />
Footprints on the sands of time."

<h2><a name="CHRISTOPHER_COLUMBUS" id="CHRISTOPHER_COLUMBUS"></a>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS</h2>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa, Italy, more than four
hundred and fifty years ago. Genoa was a rich town on the
Mediterranean Sea. She had trading routes to India, China and Japan.</p>

<p class="narr">Columbus was fond of stories of the sea and liked the study of
geography. He was anxious to go to sea and while a boy made his
first voyage. When he grew up to be a man, he went to Lisbon the
capital of Portugal. The bold deeds of Henry of Portugal drew many
seamen to this city.</p>

<p class="narr">Lisbon was full of learned men and sailors longing to go on long
voyages. These sailors had tried to find a shorter way to India but
without success.</p>

<p class="narr">Columbus thought this could be done by going directly west. He
thought the world round although most people at that time thought it
flat. After many trails he laid his plans before the Court of the
King of Spain.</p>

<p class="narr">The first act will be Columbus at the Court of Spain.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>

<p class="stage1">(King and Queen on throne&mdash;courtiers around.)</p>

<p class="stage1">(Columbus enters and bows before king and queen.)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Q. Isabella</span>: You have come to us to talk about a shorter way to
India?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Columbus</span>: Yes, your Majesty. According to this map and the proof I
have gathered, I believe India to be directly west. I have gone on
long voyages and have talked to many seamen about the signs of land
to the westward. I believe the world to be round and if your Majesty
could aid me I know I could find this shorter route.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: We would be glad indeed to aid you, but at the present time
Spain has little money. The war has taken so much.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wise Man of Spain</span>: Your Majesty, this man thinks the world round.
That is foolish. If you use your eyes you can see it is flat. To
sail westward in the hope of getting to India is impossible and
ridiculous.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wise Man</span>: Your Majesty, I think this man right. He says the world is
round and I think if we study carefully, we will find it is so. If
it is possible we should give him a chance.</p>

<p class="stagecent">
<i>End of Act I.</i>
</p>

<h3>ACT II.</h3>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">Columbus receiving little encouragement and after several years of
waiting, set out to try his fortune in France. He stopped at a
convent to beg for some bread. The Prior became interested in his
plan and went to the Court of Spain, and begged the Queen not to
allow Columbus to go to France but to help him in his plans.</p>

<p class="narr">The next act will be Columbus talking to Queen.</p>

<div class="pagenum">
<!-- Page 6 -->

<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a>
</div>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Columbus, I will pledge my jewels in order to raise the money
for a fleet. I will fit out an expedition and make you Governor over
the land you discover.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Columbus</span>: Thank you, your Majesty. The lands discovered will be
taken up in the name of the King of Spain.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Will you take a vow to use the riches you obtain to help
drive out the Turks from the Holy City of Jerusalem?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Columbus</span>: I will take that vow.</p>

<p class="stagecent">
(<i>Columbus takes vow</i>).
</p>

<p class="stagecent">
<i>End of Act II.</i>
</p>

<p class="narr">The voyage across the ocean was a long and tiresome one. The sailors
became discouraged and wanted to return to Spain. Columbus kept on
and finally was rewarded. The next act will be the discovery of
land.</p>

<h3>ACT III.</h3>

<p class="stage1">(Columbus talking to sailors:)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Columbus</span>: I rejoice my friends that you have had the grace to chant
the vesper hymn in so devout a spirit at a moment when there is so
much reason to be grateful to God for His goodness to us. What
cheering signs have encouraged us to persevere. The birds in the
air, the unusual fishes in the sea and the plants seldom met far
from rocks where they grow. I deem it probable that we reach the
land this very night. I call on you all to be watchful.</p>

<p class="stage1">(Columbus and Luis walk apart from the other sailors. Columbus a
little in advance, stops, calls Luis.)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Columbus</span>: Luis! Look in that direction, seest thou aught uncommon?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Luis</span>: I saw a light, Senor.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Columbus</span>: Thine eyes did not deceive thee.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Luis</span>: What think you, Don Christopher?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Columbus</span>: Land! Bid Rodrigo Sanchez of Segovia to come hither.</p>

<p class="stagecent">
(Rodrigo Sanchez comes. All look for light).
</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Columbus</span>: This is land. We will behold it soon.</p>

<p class="stagecent">
(Sailors come up and look. All exclaim, Land! Land!)
</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Columbus</span>: See the land, Luis?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Luis</span>: Yes.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Columbus</span>: Behold the Indies! Praise be to God!</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_SMITH_and_POCAHONTAS" id="JOHN_SMITH_and_POCAHONTAS"></a>JOHN SMITH <i>and</i> POCAHONTAS</h2>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">John Smith was the savior of Virginia. He was an officer in the new
colony sent out to Jamestown. Captain Newport one of Raleigh's old
sea captains brought a colony of one hundred settlers to America.</p>

<p class="narr">The first act will be Captain Newport talking to some London
merchants.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">First Merchant</span>: The King has given us a charter for our new colony
in America.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Second Merchant</span>: We need some men of adventure.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Capt. Newport</span>: I know a man, John Smith, who could make the colony a
success. He has had as wonderful adventures as the knights of old.
He has just returned from fighting the Turks.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Merchant</span>: We will see if the King will make him one of the officers
in the company.</p>

<p class="stagecent">
<i>End of Act I.</i>
</p>

<h3>ACT II.</h3>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">Smith was made an officer but was not allowed to take part in
governing the Colony but resolved to help by visiting the Indians
and gathering food for the Colony. The next act will be Smith in the
Indian village.</p>

<p class="stage1">(Powhatan sitting around bench. His wives sit at his side. Women and
children stand around. In front stood Powhatan's fierce warriors.
Two big stones are rolled in front of Powhatan. Two warriors rush to
Smith, drag him to the stones and force his head upon one of them).
(Pocahontas the chief's daughter rushes in.)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pocahontas</span>: Save his life! Do not kill him!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Powhatan</span>: Your life is saved. You will be my son and play with my

<h3>ACT III.</h3>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">After awhile Smith returned to Jamestown. He found much trouble
among the settlers. He took command and with the help of Pocahontas
the little Indian maiden, restored order and saved them from
starvation. Pocahontas was ever afterwards called "The good angel of
the Colony." The next act will be Smith talking to the settlers.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Smith</span>: (Making speech). Every one of us must work. He that will not
work shall not eat. You shall not only gather for yourself, but for
those that are sick. They shall not starve. Some of you will plant
grain, others will build better houses. If this will take place we
will all be happier and more contented in Virginia.</p>

<h2><a name="SIR_WALTER_RALEIGH" id="SIR_WALTER_RALEIGH"></a>SIR WALTER RALEIGH</h2>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">Walter Raleigh was the Englishman who checked the power of the
Spanish in America. He was a friend of Queen Elizabeth, and first
gained her friendship, by an interesting incident. This act tells
the story.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>

<p class="stage1">(Walter Raleigh, Blount, and Tracy, walking along shore see boat of
the Queen.)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Blount</span>: See, the Queen's barge lies at the stairs. We had best put
back and tell the Earl what we have seen.</p>

today, I wot.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Raleigh</span>: This cloak shall never be brushed while in my possession.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Blount</span>: He is in attendance on me, the noble Earl of Sussex, Master
of Horse.</p>

thank you for your service, though the manner of offering was
something bold.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Raleigh</span>: In a sovereign's need, it is each man's duty to be bold.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: (Speaking to attendant). That is well said, my lord. (To
Raleigh) Well, young man, your gallantry shall not go unrewarded.
Thou shalt have a suit, and that of the newest cut.</p>

<h2><a name="SIR_FRANCIS_DRAKE" id="SIR_FRANCIS_DRAKE"></a>SIR FRANCIS DRAKE</h2>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">Sir Francis Drake was the English "Dragon" who sailed the Spanish
Main and who "singed the King of Spain's beard." He was a most
daring seaman. From boyhood he had been a sailor. The first act will
be Drake at the Court of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>

<p class="stagecent">
<span class="smcap">Queen Elizabeth and Court</span>
</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">First Maid of Honor</span>: Francis Drake has returned from his voyage
around the world.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Tell me about this Francis Drake.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Second Maid of Honor</span>: He is a cousin of Captain Hawkins and was with
him when he had command of a ship against Mexico. The Spaniards
killed many of the sailors and took all they had.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Court</span>: He hates the Spanish because he thought they were plotting to
kill your Majesty.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Bring me to Francis Drake. I will visit him on his ship.</p>

<p class="stage1">(Enter Queen and Court.)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: How do you do, Francis Drake. They tell me you have made a
voyage around the world.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Drake</span>: Yes, your Majesty.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Tell me of your trip.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Drake</span>: (Map and pointer showing the trip). We left England and
sailed straight for the Strait of Magellan. I was determined to sail
the Pacific. We entered this harbor. This is where Magellan spent a
winter when he made his trip around the world. One of my men will
tell you what happened here.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Man</span>: We sailed safely through the Strait but a terrible storm arose.
One of our ships were lost and one sailed for England. We went from
here, south and here we saw the first great treasure ship. We
captured four hundred pounds of gold.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Drake</span>: Week after week we sailed northward until we reached Peru,
Pizarro's conquered land.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Man</span>: Here we saw another great treasure ship. We pursued her and
captured more than twenty tons of silver bars, thirteen chests of
silver and a great store of precious gems.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Drake</span>: We sailed northward and back again southward and spent a time
in this beautiful bay. I named the country New Albion and took
possession in your Majesty's name.</p>

with them always.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Drake</span>: We sailed on until we saw the island where Magellan had been.
We sailed on through the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope
and back to England.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: Kneel Francis Drake (Drake kneels and is knighted by Queen).
Arise, Sir Francis Drake.</p>

<h3>ACT II.</h3>

<p class="narr">Drake again went to fight the Spaniards. He sailed boldly for the
coast of Spain. He captured shipload after shipload of treasure. He
made the Spanish King very angry by his actions and the King
resolved to crush England. Drake sailed right into the harbor of
Cadiz. He burned so many Spanish ships that it took Spain another
year to get the fleet ready.</p>

<p class="narr">The next act will be Drake and others talking to the Queen after the
Spanish Armada had been destroyed.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: My brave and noble Sir Francis Drake, you have crushed the
Spanish power on the sea for all time I think.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Noble</span>: He has certainly more than singed the King of Spain's beard
this time.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Drake</span>: The terrible storm that came up helped us to destroy the
Spanish Fleet.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Queen</span>: From now on our power on the sea will grow greater and
greater. We can now go to America without danger from the Spanish.</p>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">The Pilgrims were persecuted for their religion in England. They
went first to Holland. After a time they decided to come to America
because they wanted their children to grow up in their own language
and customs.</p>

<p class="narr">They set sail for America in the Mayflower. They had a long and
dangerous journey, but on November 20, 1620 they found themselves
looking with glad hearts upon the sandy but heavily-wooded shores of
Cape Cod. They signed an agreement as to the government of the
Colony and elected John Carver their first Governor.</p>

land here?</p>

<i>and</i><br />
OTHER HEROES OF THE REVOLUTION</h2>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION: (Told by pupil).</h3>

<p class="narr">We are now going to tell you the story of George Washington and
other heroes of the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p class="narr">George Washington was the first president of the United States and
was called "The Father of His Country." As a boy he was a skilful
horseback rider and liked to go into the forest with his dog and
hunt. He had a very good mother. His father called her "The Rose of
Epping Forest"&mdash;a place in England.</p>

<p class="stage1">(Maps are used and pupil points out the places on maps with
pointer).</p>

<p class="narr">The first act will be George Washington talking to his mother.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>: Mother, it is decided that I should go to sea, is it
not?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Washington</span>: Yes, George, we had consented to your going to sea
but I would much rather have you go back to school and have a good
education. According to these old Virginia days the oldest son in
the family, when the father dies, receives a plantation and your
brother, Laurence, has received a plantation on the Potomac.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>: Well, mother, if I give up my plans of going to sea and
go back to school, what shall I do?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Washington</span>: You will receive a plantation on the Rappahannock.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>: Well, I shall give up all my plans and go back to school
and I will try to excel in all my work.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Washington</span>: You must excel in both work and play and remember
the Golden Rule&mdash;"Do unto others as you would have them do unto
you."</p>

<p class="stage1">(Several boys knock and enter&mdash;boys bow and speak to Mrs.
Washington).</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Boys</span>: How do you do, Mrs. Washington.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Washington</span>: How do you do, boys.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">First Boy</span>: George, we want you to come out and play with us.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Second Boy</span>: Yes, we want you to be our captain.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Third Boy</span>: We will take a walk in the woods.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Fourth Boy</span>: And maybe have a swim in the old swimming pool.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>: May I go out with the boys, mother?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Washington</span>: Yes, George, but don't forget to come in before it

<h3>ACT II.</h3>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">When George Washington was sixteen, he was made a surveyor for Lord
Fairfax. At twenty he was put in Braddock's army and he saved the
broken pieces. He was later elected to the house of Burgesses in
Virginia.</p>

<p class="narr">After Washington's brother, Laurence, died, Washington received the
beautiful Mt. Vernon plantation on the Potomac.</p>

<p class="narr">One day while Washington was on his way to Williamsburg, he met a
beautiful woman named Mrs. Martha Custis, who later became his wife.</p>

<p class="narr">The second act will be Washington, Patrick Henry and others in the
house of Burgesses in Virginia.</p>

<p class="stage1">(House of Burgesses assembled. Class in House of Burgesses.)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Speaker at Desk</span>: As you know the French and Indian war has left both
England and her colonies in debt and King George, thinking only of
England, put a tax on tea and a Stamp Act on the Thirteen Colonies.
Through such great men as Samuel Adams and our own Patrick Henry,
these Acts have been repealed. Now we are confronted with the
trouble in Boston. Shall the people of Boston be slaves or shall the
thirteen colonies fight to save that town?</p>

<p class="stage1">(Exclamations from House). Fight! Fight! No! No! Fight!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: I think Patrick Henry has a resolution to offer.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Patrick Henry</span>: Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen: I offer resolutions
declaring that Virginia arm herself for the coming war.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Men of House</span>: Why should we fight England? It is the greatest
country in the world and it is our Mother Country.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Second Man of House</span>: Why not send petitions to the King asking him
to send his two armies out of Boston?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Third Man of House</span>: We cannot fight England. Look at Drake. He
checked the Spanish Armada on the sea while Raleigh checked the
Spanish on the land. If we fight England it will leave us weaker
than we are.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Fourth Man of House</span>: If we fight our Mother Country now it will
spoil the little nation we are trying to build up. We are not ready
to fight.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Patrick Henry</span>: Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Speaker</span>: Mr. Henry.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Henry</span>: We must fight! I repeat it, Sir, we must fight. An appeal to
arms and the God of Hosts is all that is left to us. They tell us,
Sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an
adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be next year, or
next week? Sir, we are not weak if we make the proper use which the
God of Nature has placed in our power. Our chains are forged! Their
clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is
inevitable, and let it come! Our brothers are all ready on the
field. Why stand we here idle! Is life so dear or peace so sweet as
to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it
Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me,
give me liberty, or give me death! (Much applause).</p>

Continental Congress we pledged to stand by Boston. If General Gage
means to make war on that town, let him do it. Is there anything to
say on the matter, gentlemen?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hancock</span>: Mr. Franklin.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Franklin</span>: I say that the thirteen colonies should unite in order to
fight Great Britain.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Henry</span>: Mr. Hancock.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hancock</span>: Mr. Henry.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Henry</span>: I agree with Mr. Benjamin Franklin. I wish to repeat a
statement I made once before. The distinctions between Virginians,
Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers and New Englanders are no more. I am not
a Virginian but an American. (Applause).</p>

Britain.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of House</span>: We must show reasons for separating from our Mother

of Pennsylvania, Robert R. Livingston of New York, Roger Sherman of
Connecticut and John Adams of Massachusetts to draw up a declaration
of independence. And now gentlemen, the American Army needs a head.
Who shall it be?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">P. Henry</span>: I think Mr. Adams has a man in view.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hancock</span>: Mr. Adams.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Adams</span>: I have but one man in mind, a gentleman from Virginia, whose
skill and experience as an officer, whose independent fortune, great
talents and excellent universal character would command the
approbation of all America and unite the Colonies better than any
other person in the Union. If you speak of solid information and
sound judgment, Colonel Washington is unquestionably the greatest
man on the floor.</p>

Declaration of Independence as written by Thomas Jefferson of
Virginia is about to be accepted. Is there anything more to say on
the subject, gentlemen? Mr. Jefferson have you?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Jefferson</span>: Mr. Hancock and Gentlemen. We feel that good reasons must
be shown to the world and to those brave Englishmen, Pitt and Burke
who have been our defenders for breaking away from our Mother
Country. We have tried to show these causes in the paper that I have
written.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hancock</span>: Mr. Adams.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Adams</span>: Mr. Hancock. We believe that all men are created equal with
the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The present
King of England has shown himself a tyrant in his treatment of the
Colonies by his repeated acts. Thomas Jefferson has written these
facts so the world may see them.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hancock</span>: Mr. Sherman.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sherman</span>: Mr. Hancock. He has taxed us unjustly, without giving us a
voice in the matter. He has tried to force us to pay the debts of
England. These are more reasons we wish to give to the world for our
present action.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hancock</span>: Mr. Franklin.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Franklin</span>: We have sent petitions to him asking him to stop these
abuses. He has answered with insult. A prince with such a character
is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. We therefore, declare we
are enemies in war, in peace friends.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Lee</span>: Mr. Hancock.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hancock</span>: Mr. Lee.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lee</span>: I make a motion that the Declaration of Independence as written
by Mr. Jefferson be accepted and the news be given to the world that
we are a free people.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of House</span>: I second that motion.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hancock</span>: It has been moved and seconded that the Declaration of
Independence be accepted and the news be given to the world that we
are a free people. All those in favor say Aye.</p>

<p class="stage2">Aye! Aye!</p>

<p class="speakerctd">Contrary minded, No. And now gentlemen, I sign my name in large
letters so George Third may read it without spectacles (writes
name). We must all hang together in this matter.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Franklin</span>: Yes, we must all hang together, or we will hang
separately.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hancock</span>: And now let the news be given to the world that we are a

<h2><a name="GEORGE_ROGERS_CLARK" id="GEORGE_ROGERS_CLARK"></a>GEORGE ROGERS CLARK</h2>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">George Rogers Clark was born in Virginia in 1752. Clark liked to
roam the woods. He became a surveyor and an Indian fighter at the
age of twenty-one. He was a great leader in Kentucky along with
Boone and fought the Indians many times. The British officers
aroused the Indians. They paid a certain sum for each scalp of an
American. Clark decided to strike a blow at the British across the
Ohio. He drilled his men at Corn Island at the falls of the Ohio,
the beginning of Louisville. In June he shot the falls and after a
long march they reached the old French town of Kaskaskia.</p>

<p class="narr">The first Act will be a dance at Kaskaskia.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>

<p class="stage1">(British and French dancing. Enter Clark and stands at door. Indian
lying on floor springs to feet and gives terrible war whoop. The
dancing stops. Women scream and men rush toward Clark).</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clark</span>: Go on with your dance but remember you dance under Virginia
and not under Great Britain.</p>

<p class="stage1">(British General goes up to Clark).</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clark</span>: I ask you to surrender in the name of Virginia.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">British General</span>: I surrender. (Hands his sword to Clark).</p>

<p class="stage1">(French talk in corner. Father Gibault and other men come up to talk
with Clark).</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Father Gibault</span>: We beg of you, Colonel Clark, to spare our lives and
the lives of our families.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clark</span>: Father, your lives are safe. America makes war on no church
and will protect you all from insult. The King of France has made a
treaty with the United States and is sending ships and soldiers to
help us. All we want you to do is put up the American Flag.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Father Gibault</span>: We are glad to hear this news. It makes us all very
happy indeed. I will go to Vincennes and tell the good news.</p>

<h2><a name="ANDREW_JACKSON" id="ANDREW_JACKSON"></a>ANDREW JACKSON</h2>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">Andrew Jackson was born in North Carolina in 1767. His parents were
Scotch Irish.</p>

<p class="narr">Schools were few and poor and Andy learned more from the woods than
from books. As a boy he was full of fun and mischief and fond of
sports, but he was very hot tempered.</p>

<p class="narr">When he was thirteen he learned what war meant for it was the time
of the Revolution. Colonel Tarleton killed more than a hundred of
Jackson's neighbors and friends, among them Andy's own brother. He
never forgave the British.</p>

<p class="narr">At fourteen he was taken prisoner by the British.</p>

<p class="narr">The first act will be Andrew Jackson and a British officer. Enter
soldiers dragging Andrew. Officer at desk. Men salute officer.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Men</span>: We have found this young fellow acting in a suspicious manner
around the camp, Colonel.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Officer</span>: Well, well, a young rebel eh!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>: Yes, a rebel.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Officer</span>: We'll see what you are good for, boy. Clean these boots.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span>: I will not. I am a prisoner of war and expect to be treated
as such.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Officer</span>: You won't! Won't you! (Draws sword and strikes boy on
head). (Soldiers drag him from room).</p>

<p class="stagecent">
<i>End of Act I.</i>
</p>

<h3>ACT II.</h3>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">At Camden smallpox killed his remaining brother and left Andrew poor
and sickly looking. His mother also lost her life in caring for
American prisoners. Jackson was left an orphan of the Revolution. He
studied law and at twenty was admitted to practice in the courts of
the State.</p>

<p class="narr">Stories from Tennessee made him long to see that beautiful country,
so in company with nearly a hundred men, women and children he
crossed the mountains into Tennessee.</p>

<p class="narr">The next Act will be Jackson and others sitting around a camp-fire,
telling stories of the Revolution.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span>: This beautiful country of Nolichucky Jack's is worth the
trouble we have had in coming. Something in the stillness of the
night makes me think of those dreadful Revolutionary days. What a
time it was and what a lot of great heroes our country had.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">One of Men</span>: Yes, those were stirring days. Well do I remember that
day on the Boston Common. On the slopes of the hill where the State
House now stands there was a fine place to skate and slide. We
fellows learned our spelling those days for if we didn't we couldn't
skate. One day after school we hurried to the hillside. We found the
ice broken everywhere. We knew the

<!-- Page 22 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
British Redcoats had done the
damage. They thought it fun to make the Yankees angry. We went to
General Gage and told him what his soldiers had done. He said "You
are plucky boys. If my soldiers bother you again, let me know."</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">One of the Girls</span>: Have you ever heard the story of Lydia Darrah?</p>

<p class="stage2">No, tell us.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">Lydia was my grandmother. She lived in Philadelphia with her husband
and younger children. General Howe's adjutant took up his quarters
and secured a back room in which private councils could be held.
Just before one of these my grandmother was told to retire early as
the British officers would require the room at seven o'clock and
would remain late. Lydia suspected that something against the
patriot army was to take place. She sent the family to bed and
taking off her shoes crept down the stairs and listened at the door.
She learned that all the British troops were to march out and
surprise General Washington and his army. She knew it lay in her
power to save the lives of thousands of people. She decided to find
a way of telling the news.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">Going to the mill for flour, she left her sack to be filled and
hurried on to the American camp where she told one of the officers
she knew. He galloped off to Headquarters and informed General
Washington.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">The British officers never knew who gave Washington the information.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span>: She was a brave woman. There were many brave women and men.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Man</span>: And that fight at Bunker Hill. Of course we lost because we
didn't have enough powder but how our brave boys did fight, as long
as the powder held out. They cut down whole ranks of the British
army as they advanced up the shore.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span>: Well folks, I think we better go to bed. We have a hard
journey ahead of us. I will keep watch.</p>

<p class="stage1">(Jackson leans up against tree, smoking corncob pipe).</p>

<p class="stage1">(Suddenly the sound of an owl is heard in the distance).</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span> speaks to the man with him: "A little too natural that owl.
I fear it is Indians. We must arouse the people and go."</p>

<p class="stage1">(Goes and arouses people who get ready to leave.)</p>

<p class="stagecent">
<i>End of Act II.</i>
</p>

<h3>ACT III.</h3>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">Jackson was successful as a lawyer; was made district attorney and
was finally elected to Congress. Later became a frontier judge and a
man of business. He won fame as a fighter in the war of 1812, and in
many fights with the Indians and won the name of "Old Hickory."</p>

<p class="narr">The next act will be calling for volunteers to fight at New Orleans.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Jackson's Speech</span>: The British are again our enemies. They are
capturing our men on the high seas and forcing them to fight for
Great Britain. Shall we stand this? No, I say no. Perry and other
great sailors are fighting hard with

<i>End of Act III.</i>
</p>

<h3>ACT IV</h3>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">After the Battle of New Orleans Jackson was a great hero. In 1828 he
was elected President of the United States. He had bitter quarrels
with Clay, Calhoun and Webster over the U. S. Banks. In the Senate
was another great man, Thomas H. Benton. He and Jackson had once
fought a duel but were now good friends. Benton took Jackson's part
against the other men. Refusal of South Carolina to pay the tariff
caused trouble during Jackson's time. This act was called
nullification.</p>

<p class="narr">The next act will be President Jackson talking to General Scott
about South Carolina.</p>

<h3>ACT IV</h3>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Jackson</span>: South Carolina must be forced to obey the laws of the land.
The tariff will be collected by force if necessary. To nullify an
Act of Congress would be most dangerous to the Union. Take soldiers
and war vessels, General Scott, to Charleston and enforce the law at
all hazards.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">General Scott</span>: I will do my best to enforce the laws of the land,
President Jackson.</p>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">John C. Fremont was born in Savannah, in the year 1813, while his
parents were on a journey through the South. His father died soon
after, and his mother moved to Charleston, South Carolina. He was
well educated, and after college spent some years in travel.</p>

<p class="narr">He joined a company of engineers to explore the mountains between
Tennessee and South Carolina to find a place for a railway. This
region was a rough, beautiful, and wild country, and it gave Fremont
a taste for exploring which never left him. His longing for wild
life was gratified when he was made assistant to a famous Frenchman
who went to explore the region between the Missouri and Canada.</p>

<p class="narr">He married Jessie Benton, daughter of the famous Senator Benton.
Benton was interested in the growth of the West. He knew that
Fremont was interested in exploring, and used his influence with
President Van Buren to have Fremont explore the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p class="narr">The first act will be Fremont talking to President Van Buren.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>

<p class="stage1">(Senator Benton talking to Van Buren:)</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Benton</span>: The West is a great country, Mr. President. We should have
it explored and investigated.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Van Buren</span>: I agree with you, Senator Benton. The West should be
explored. If we had a good man to send on this expedition.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Benton</span>: I know a man, Mr. President; John C. Fremont. He is an
experienced engineer, and loves the wild life of adventure.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Van Buren</span>: Bring Fremont to me.</p>

<p class="stage1">(Fremont enters and is introduced by Benton).</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Van Buren</span>: You are an explorer of note, Mr. Fremont? Will you
undertake a journey to the Rocky Mountains and bring back a report
of that country?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Fremont</span>: Yes, I am very much interested in exploring the West, and

<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a>
</div>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Fremont</span>: I have just returned from my explorations, and would like
to tell you of the trips. On my first trip I left Kansas City and
followed the Kansas River to the South Pass. On my second trip I
followed the same route to the South Pass, where I took four men,
and continued on, to the highest peak in the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">One of the Men</span>: While there and on the top, we unfurled the stars
and stripes in all its glory.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Fremont</span>: Then I decided to cross the mountains. After many weary
months we beheld a great lake.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">One of the Men</span>: You can imagine what feelings stirred the breasts of
men shut in for months by mountains, at seeing what appeared to us
to be an ocean here in the midst of a continent.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Fremont</span>: As we strained our eyes along its silent shores, I could
hardly repress the almost desire to continue our explorations.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Man</span>: After making preparations, we crossed over the mountains till
we reached the Columbia River, and traveled down to Vancouver. Here
we were the guests of the Governor of the British Hudson Bay
Company.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Fremont</span>: On November tenth, we started across the Sierra Nevada
Mountains, and then on, till we came to Sutter's Fort.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Man</span>: Here we met the remarkable Captain Sutter. Captain Sutter is a
native of Switzerland. He came here with the intention of building a
colony. The Spanish Governor, Alvarado, gladly gave him a great
tract of land. Captain Sutter has great herds of cattle and many
acres of grain.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Fremont</span>: We then decided to cross the mountains farther to the
south, where the San Joaquin River makes a gap. Here we beheld a
great desert.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Man</span>: An Indian told us that there was neither water nor
grass&mdash;nothing. Every animal that goes on this desert dies.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Fremont</span>: From here we traveled forward, reaching Salt Lake; having
made a circuit of the Great Basin. Here we are, with the story of
our trip.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">President</span>: You have had some wonderful experiences. And now, Mr.
Fremont, I would like you to go on a third expedition&mdash;to explore
the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p class="narr">Fremont did not know about the war with Mexico. On his way to the

one hundred and fifty horses. The Americans captured these horses.
That was the first victory in the conquest of California.</p>

<p class="narr">The Americans were indeed a rough looking lot. Mounted on horseback,
wearing leggings, and carrying pistols and guns. If the Americans
had known that war was going on, they would have raised the Stars
and Stripes. But not knowing it they decided to make a flag of their own.</p>

<h2><a name="WEBSTER_CLAY_and_CALHOUN" id="WEBSTER_CLAY_and_CALHOUN"></a>WEBSTER, CLAY <i>and</i> CALHOUN</h2>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">We are going to tell you the story of Webster, Clay and Calhoun.</p>

<p class="narr">Daniel Webster was born in New Hampshire in 1782. He was a very
weakly child, no one thought that some day he would have an iron
body. He spent most of his time playing in the woods and fields. He
loved the animals that he found there. He had a brother named
Ezekiel. One day as they were walking through the field, they
noticed that some of the cabbage had been eaten so they planned to
catch the thief.</p>

<p class="narr">The first act will be the story of the woodchuck.</p>

<h3>ACT I</h3>

<p class="stage1">(Daniel and Ezekiel find woodchuck in trap).</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>: Well Daniel I see that we have caught the woodchuck.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>: What shall we do with him?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>: I think that we should kill him.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>: I think we should take him into the woods and let him go.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>: Let us take the matter to father and let him settle it. (Go
to father).</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>: Father, we have caught the woodchuck and we do not know what
to do with him. We have brought the matter to you to settle. Ezekiel
wants to kill him and I want to let him go.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Father</span>: Well boys, we will hold a court. I will be the judge and you
will be the lawyers. One defend the case and the other prosecute.
Ezekiel you may speak first, you are the prosecutor.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>: I think we should kill the woodchuck. If we let him go, he
will be just as much trouble as ever, while if we kill him he can't
eat any more cabbage and we can sell his skin for at least ten cents
and small as that sum is it will help pay for some of the cabbage
that he has eaten, so in either way he is of more value dead than
alive.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Father</span>: Very good, Ezekiel. Now Daniel we will hear from you.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Daniel's Speech</span>: God made the woodchuck. He made him to live in the
bright sunlight and the pure air. He made him to enjoy the free air
and the good woods. The woodchuck is not a fierce animal like the
wolf or the fox. He lives in quiet and peace. A hole in the side of
a hill and a little food is all that he wants. He has harmed nothing
but a few plants which he ate to keep himself alive. The woodchuck
has a right to life, to food, to liberty, for God gave them to him.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">Look at his soft pleading eyes. See him tremble with fear. He cannot
speak for himself and this is the only way he can plead for the life
that is so sweet to him. Shall we be so cruel as to kill him? Shall
we be so selfish as to take from him the life that God gave him?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Father</span>: Ezekiel, Ezekiel, let that woodchuck go!</p>

<h3>ACT II.</h3>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION: <span class="smcap">Webster.</span></h3>

<p class="narr">One day in spring, Daniel Webster's father took Daniel to Exeter
Academy to prepare for college. All the boys laughed at his rustic
dress and manners.</p>

<p class="narr">He finally entered Dartmouth College at the age of fifteen. He was
the best student there. All the students liked him. At the age of
eighteen he gave a Fourth of July oration in his college town. After
he had finished at Dartmouth, he taught school in order to help his
parents send his older brother to school. Later, he entered
Christopher Gore's law office. He studied very hard and won name and
fame as a lawyer.</p>

<p class="narr">The approach of the war of 1812 brought him into politics.</p>

<p class="narr">He was elected to Congress and took his seat in 1813.</p>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION: <span class="smcap">Henry Clay.</span></h3>

<p class="narr">Henry Clay was born in Virginia at the year of Burgoyne's surrender,
1777. His father died when he was four years old. Little Henry lived
near the "Slashes" the name given to a low flat region and went to
school in a log cabin. He worked on a farm to do his share in the
support of the family. Sometimes he would be seen barefooted behind
the plow or else riding a horse to mill. From this he was called the
"Mill boy of the Slashes." At fourteen he was a clerk in a store but
he was made for better use.</p>

<p class="narr">He was put in the office of a famous lawyer who was a clerk in one
of Virginia's courts. He went to Richmond and studied law there. He
formed a debating club and was made leader. From here he went to
Lexington. There his rise in law was rapid, his fame grew and he was
known as a lawyer who seldom lost his case.</p>

<p class="narr">He was elected to the House of Representatives and was made speaker.
As speaker he helped to bring on the War of 1812.</p>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION: <span class="smcap">John C. Calhoun.</span></h3>

<p class="narr">Calhoun was born in the same year as Webster, 1782. He was born in
South Carolina. His parents were Scotch-Irish. He learned more from
the woods than he did from books and filled his memory before people
could fill it. At the age of eighteen he began to prepare for
college with the aid of his brother-in-law, a Presbyterian minister.
Two years later he entered Yale College, studied hard and soon
graduated with much honor. He studied law for three years, a year
and a half in his own state and a year and a half in Connecticut. He
began to practice law in South Carolina. He did not have much
success. Perhaps the law was too dry for him or perhaps because he
was soon to be elected to Congress.</p>

<p class="narr">In 1811 he was married and elected to Congress.</p>

<p class="narr">Henry Clay (Speaker) immediately put Calhoun on an important
committee.</p>

<p class="narr">The next act will be John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster and Henry Clay
speaking of the war of 1812.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clay</span> (speaker): Members of Congress and fellow citizens: England has
been at war with France for a number of years. France under Napoleon
has secured a large part of Europe. England has tried in various
ways to injure France by proclaiming that no ships of any nation
shall trade with France.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">Napoleon retorted, issuing a decree that no ships shall trade with
Europe and these laws hurt American commerce. Shall we stand this or
demand our rights?</p>

<p class="speakerctd">Gentlemen, I say we must fight. On to Canada!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of House</span>: I think we should be very careful about going to
war with Great Britain. She has a thousand war vessels, while the
United States has only ten or twelve first-class vessels.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of Congress</span>: England's troops are numerous, well drilled and
have had much experience. Our troops are few and poorly disciplined
and unused to war. I think, all matters in dispute could be arranged
without fighting.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of Congress</span>: We would make a great mistake to fight England
and France at the same time.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Webster</span>: The British in taking our men have made it a practice to
stop American merchant ships and seize the best sailors. They claim
these men are British citizens and could be rightfully seized.
Whenever they see a fine looking seaman, they say: "You are an
Englishman, we will take you!" We must fight with the navy. If the
war must be continued go to the ocean. There the united wishes and
exertions of the nation will go with you. Even our party divisions
end at the water's edge.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Calhoun</span>: We have tried in various ways to induce England and
France to change these laws. These are not the only grievances we
have. England has a large navy. She needs many sailors. When our
ships were in her parts, she has seized our men and forced them on
her ships. Is this right? Must we stand such treatment? No! So we
call forth the patriotism and resources of our country to help us.</p>

<h3>ACT III</h3>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">From 1819 to 1821, Congress was debating over the Missouri
Compromise. The north opposed and the south favored. The excitement
spread to the state Legislature and to the people. Many meetings
were held.</p>

<p class="narr">Finally Henry Clay succeeded in getting Congress to pass the
Missouri Compromise. This act admitted Missouri as a slave state.</p>

<p class="narr">Hayne had spoken against a protective tariff and for nullification
and Daniel Webster felt called upon to reply so he made a great
speech. His speech was considered by good judges the best ever
delivered in Congress. He was probably the greatest orator of his
time.</p>

<p class="narr">South Carolina refused to pay the tariff in 1832 and nullified the
law of Congress. President Jackson hurried the army and navy to make
her pay.</p>

<p class="narr">John Calhoun was for nullification. He said to save the South from
the North, a state had a right to nullify a law of Congress.</p>

<div class="pagenum">

<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a>
</div>

<p class="narr">The third act will be Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and John C.
Calhoun, speaking on the right of nullification.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Speaker Clay</span>: Gentlemen, we have been debating on the right of a
state to nullify. We must think of this matter in a calm manner. It
is one of the most serious times of our country. Our Union is in
danger. We have heard Mr. Hayne speak on Nullification; also Mr.
Calhoun.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of Congress</span>: Congress has no right to force another state to
pay a tariff and we declare a state has a right to nullify.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of Congress</span>: President Jackson says the Federal Union must
and shall be preserved. He has warned the people of South Carolina
that any attempt at resistance will be put down with a high hand. We
of the North feel that this must be done in order to save the Union.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of Congress</span>: Tariff is helpful to the North but not to the
South. There is always a difference between the North and South and
we of the South feel that nullification is right to save us from the
North.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Calhoun</span>: Mr. Clay.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Clay</span>: Mr. Calhoun.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Calhoun</span>: The Southern people using slave labor will raise more
tobacco and cotton than they need so the tariff is hurtful to them.
The Northern people using free labor will manufacture all kinds of
things and the tariff is helpful to them. The Southern people are
for agriculture. The Northern people for manufacturing. The Southern
are for slavery and the Northern are for free labor. To protect the
South from the North the state has the right to nullify a law of
Congress. The state has the right because the state is above the
nation. The states made the constitution.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">I believe that nullification is a means of saving the Union from
secession.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Haynes</span>: That is the way I feel, Gentlemen. Nullification is right.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Webster</span>: Mr. Clay.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Clay</span>: Mr. Webster.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Webster</span>: We must not let South Carolina refuse to obey the laws
of the Union. For if she does she leaves the Union. If South
Carolina leaves the Union other states will also leave. Gentlemen of
Congress: Nullification is another name for secession. When my eyes
shall be turned to behold for the last time the sun in heaven, may I
not see him shining on the broken and dishonored fragments of a once
glorious nation. But may I see our flag without a single stripe
erased or polluted, not a single star obscured but everywhere spread
all over in characters of living light, that sentiment dear to every
American heart, Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and
inseparable.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Clay</span>: Gentlemen: I offer a compromise hoping it will please both
the North and South. I propose that the tariff be gradually reduced
till 1842 when all duties shall be 20% on the value of the articles
imported. I think, gentlemen this will be a solution of the
question. We will debate on it at the next meeting.</p>

<h3>ACT IV</h3>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">It was in 1848 that our country declared war on Mexico and won it
with a great victory for the American Army. The treaty of peace with
Mexico gave the United States all the territory then known as Alta
(Upper California) and New Mexico.</p>

<p class="narr">The North and the South disputed over this territory. The South
said: "It must be open to slavery." The North said: "It must be
free." The quarrel grew so bitter that many men thought the Union
would be destroyed.</p>

<p class="narr">Kentucky legislature sent Clay back to the United States Senate by a
unanimous call, Democrats as well as Whigs joining in the vote. It
was a proud moment for the old man.</p>

<p class="narr">Webster then went back to the United States Senate where he joined
Clay in supporting the great Compromise of 1850. Calhoun opposed the
Compromise.</p>

<p class="narr">The last act will be Clay, Webster and others talking on the
Compromise of 1850.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Speaker of the House</span>: Gentlemen, for many days we have been debating
on the serious question of the danger of the South leaving the
Union. Mr. Clay will read his Compromise.</p>

<p class="stage1">(Mr. Clay enters on arm of friend. He is an old man now).</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Clay</span>: Mr. President and Gentlemen: I believe that the Union is
in danger of destruction but if we can again compromise, I think it
can be saved. This is what I propose: First that California shall be
admitted as a free state. Second: That the slave trade be stopped in
the District of Columbia. This should please the North. To please
the South, First: I propose that all Federal Officers be given
authority to hunt for slaves that have escaped to the North and
without trial or jury be returned to their masters. Second: I
propose that the new territories coming in as states decide for
themselves whether they shall be free or slave.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of Congress</span>: The fugitive slave law reads thus: 'Any slave
escaping to the North might be seized wherever found and brought
before a United States judge. He cannot give testimony, or prove
that he is not a slave. All citizens are commanded to aid in the
capture of the fugitive.' Are we willing to accept Mr. Clay's clause
in this Compromise? As for myself, gentlemen, I think not.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of Congress</span>: No, gentlemen, I do not think that we should
accept this. Many of these people have escaped into the North and
are living peaceably as free men. If this law goes into effect we
will have men who for money will go into the North and return these
people to slavery. There is a higher law even than an act of
Congress. It is the Golden Rule: 'Do unto others as you would have
them do unto you.'</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of Congress</span>: I say, Sir, we should have our slaves returned.
We need our slaves badly.</p>

<p class="stage1">(Mr. Calhoun's speech is read).</p>

<div class="pagenum">
<!-- Page 32 -->

<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a>
</div>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Clay</span>: I believe from the bottom of my soul that this measure is
the re-union of the Union.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Member of Congress</span>: Mr. Clay's country is Virginia. He does not
understand that we of the South need slaves. If we of the South
can't keep our slaves, we will leave the Union.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Clay</span>: The honorable Senator speaks of Virginia being my country.
This Union is my country, but even if my own state should raise the
standard of disunion I would go against her. I would go against
Kentucky much as I love her.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">Mr. Calhoun's speech, Mr. President.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">Mr. Calhoun is ill, I have a speech he wishes to be read.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>: Honorable Senator, read Mr. Calhoun's speech.</p>

<p class="stage1">(Mr. Calhoun's speech).</p>

<p class="speakerctd">Gentlemen of Congress: The Union is in danger today on account of
the Abolitionists. They have stirred up strife. All agitation
against slavery should be stopped. The relation existing between the
two races has existed for two centuries. We cannot permit it to be
destroyed. 'Slavery is a good, a positive good.' There should be an
equal division of territory between the North and South. If you of
the North will not do this, then let our Southern states separate
and depart in peace.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">Having faithfully done my duty to the best of my ability, both to
the Union and my section, I shall have the consolation that I am
free from all responsibility.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Webster</span>: Mr. President.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>: Mr. Webster.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Webster</span>: I wish to speak today not as a Massachusetts man nor as
a Northern man, but as an American and a member of the United States
Senate.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">I speak today for the preservation of the Union. Hear me for my
cause. I speak from an anxious heart for the return of the peace and
quiet of this Union. I should rather have heard that this Union
should never be dissolved than that word secession. Secession,
peaceable secession. Sir, your eyes and mine will never see that
miracle. Sir, I see as plainly as I see that sun in Heaven that
secession means a war. It means a war, a war I cannot describe.</p>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">After Lincoln came back from his voyage down the Mississippi, and
the Blackhawk War, he ran for the State Legislature, but was
defeated. A little later he ran again and this time he won. He said
to a friend: "Did you vote for me?" His friend said, "I did."
"Then," said Lincoln, "you must loan me two hundred dollars;" for
Lincoln needed a new suit of clothes and stage coach fare to the
Capital. Later he was sent to Congress and sometime later he was
spoken of for President.</p>

<p class="narr">The next act will be Lincoln waiting in a newspaper office in
Springfield for news of his nomination.</p>

tanner. He was brought up for farm work. Later went to West Point
from where he graduated in 1843. He distinguished himself in the
Mexican War. He resigned from the army in 1854, tried various kinds
of business in St. Louis and Galena, Illinois. On the day after the
fall of Sumter, Grant made up his mind to return to the army. In
August 1861 he became a brigadier general. From 1861 to 1863 his
name was connected with most of the successful operations in the
West, till Lincoln said of him, "I can't spare this man. He fights."
His greatest characteristic was his indomitable grit.</p>

<p class="narr">The first act will be Grant sending his answer to General Buckner at

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">Robert E. Lee was born in 1807, of an old aristocratic Virginia
family; he graduated from West Point (1829) and spent thirty-two
years in the regular army; he distinguished himself in the Mexican
War.</p>

<p class="narr">Just before the Civil War broke out, he wrote to a friend: "If the
Union is dissolved and the Government disrupted, I shall return to
my native state and share the miseries of my people, and, save in
defense, will draw my sword no more."</p>

<p class="narr">A few days after the fall of Fort Sumter, he was offered the command
of the United States Army and declined it. He resigned and after
Virginia seceded, accepted a Confederate commission. He took command

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">We are now going to tell you the story of some of the great women of
our nation, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Julia Ward
Howe, and others.</p>

<p class="narr">The first act will be Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the first champion of
Woman Suffrage, and the first Woman's Rights Convention.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Stanton Talking</span>: Ladies we are met here today to discuss women,
our social, civil and religious conditions, and the rights of women.
(Applause). For generations we have been held down by man (more
applause). I want to read to you a set of resolutions. We will call
them a Declaration of Sentiments. They will be met of course with
ridicule but that does not matter. Right is right and in time will
prevail. Here are some of the resolutions:</p>

<p class="speakerctd">First: We should have the same right as any other citizen of the
United States.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">The right to own and manage our own property.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">The right to cast a vote at an election.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">There are others that we will talk of.</p>

<p class="speakerctd">You see ladies we should have an equal vote with men. (Much
applause).</p>

<h3>ACT II.</h3>

<h3 class="h3left">INTRODUCTION:</h3>

<p class="narr">Susan B. Anthony met Mrs. Stanton soon after this convention and
though she had not been in sympathy with the "Declaration of
Sentiments" she changed and was ever after a friend of women's
suffrage. They started a weekly paper which they called "The
Revolution."</p>

<p class="narr">The next act will be Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony talking about
their paper.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Miss Stanton</span>: We must let the people of the United States see that
the only True Republic is this "Men their rights and nothing
more&mdash;Women their rights and nothing less."</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Miss Anthony</span>: Yes, this is the only way for us to get our rights. We
will organize a National Women's Suffrage Association.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Miss Stanton</span>: We will go over the country to any state we are needed
and talk to the people.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Miss Anthony</span>: Yes, I will address Congress and I will cast a vote
for the President. It is my right under the Fourteenth Amendment to

<p class="narr">For ease of navigation during classroom use, a few minor formatting
adjustments have been made in this ebook. Six speakers' names
were converted to <span class="smcap">Small Caps</span> to match the style of the text; four
cases of left-justified unattributed dialogue were indented (three
cases of "Aye! Aye!" and one case of "No, tell us."); and parentheses
were added around some stage directions to better differentiate them from dialogue.</p>
